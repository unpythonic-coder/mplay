CUSTOM VIEWS
========================================================================

If you have configured mplay to use metadata, you can 
create your own custom views by editing mplay.config,
located at: "~/.config/mplay"

You can specify attributes such as title, artist, album, duration, genre, ext, 
hr_size, and more.

-some attributes can be combined, such as title_and_year or title_and_artist.
-sep, block, and vert allow you to put separators between columns.

Custom view elements are in the form of: attribute,alignment,offset
(offset is optional).

Possible alignments include: left, quarter, third, center, twothirds, right,
justify-left, justify-right, justify-center.

In general, custom views should be defined from left to right for them to be
displayed properly, but this is less important if you are only using
justify-left, justify-right, and justify-center.

Note: if your custom view has many elements, they will not all be displayed
unless you are using a wide terminal.

Offsets are added to this alignment. Positive numbers shift the alignment
right, negative numbers shift left.

Example:

custom_view2_element1 = duration,justify-left
custom_view2_element2 = sep,left,9
custom_view2_element3 = ext,left,10
custom_view2_element4 = sep,left,17
custom_view2_element5 = hr_size,left,18
custom_view2_element6 = sep,left,31
custom_view2_element7 = block,left,32
custom_view2_element8 = title_and_artist,justify-right

Note: element7 + element8 is basically trick usage. We are filling the
right side of the screen with blocks and element8 doesn't overwrite it since
it is aligned via justify-right.
