MPLAY COMMAND ENTRY
===============================================================================
-Press 'C' (shift c) to open command entry
-This allows you to access mplay features that don't have a keybinding
-and allows you to control the player when kiosk mode is enabled
-some of these features are experimental
-commands are always in the form of "command=argument"
-commands have a session history; use the up/down arrows to choose
previously used commands, which can then be edited
-most commands that take true/false will accept true/on/yes for positive
values, and false/off/no/none for negative values
