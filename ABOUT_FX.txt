AUDIO EFFECTS (FX)
========================================================================
Mplay includes several audio effects. These FX can be used to enhance or
distort your sound.

Note: FX may increase volume or cause glitching, be very careful,
especially if using headphones. Turn down the volume before testing FX
and FX chains.

Included FX:

bitcrush        - reduce the bits (mild)
bitcrush2       - noisy bitcrusher
bitcrush3       - phasing bitcrusher
broken          - metallic and glitchy
chorus          - fattens the sound
crystal         - crystalize the sound
ear-saver       - reduces frequencies around 1500 to prevent ear fatigue
echo            - minor echo
echo2           - more echo
eq-boost-high   - boost high frequencies
eq-boost-low    - boost low end
eq-boost-mid    - boost mid range
eq-cut-high     - cut high
eq-cut-low      - cut low (removes bass)
eq-cut-mid      - cut mid range
exciter         - creates a crisper sound by generating upper frequencies
exciter2        - more extreme version of above
flanger         - create that flange sound
grunge          - makes sound grungier
highcut         - cuts high freq
highpass        - only plays high freq
limiter         - in theory, prevents a sound from playing too loud
lowcut          - cuts bass
lowpass         - only allows low frequencies
normalize       - normalizes audio so songs will play at a consistent level
phaser          - that classic phaser sound
phaser2         - more extreme phaser
pitch-down      - plays audio at a lower pitch
pitch-up        - plays audio at a higher patch
reverb          - makes sound more spacious
reverb2         - stronger reverb
tape            - sounds like old warping tape. Good with grunge.
tempo-down      - plays audio slower
tempo-up        - plays audio faster
tremolo         - volume goes up and down
vibrato         - pitch up and down
vibrato2        - stronger vibrato
widen           - widens stereo image

These effects can be set via command entry by pressing 'C' (shift 'c'):

    fx=normalize

You can chain up to four fx:

    fx = normalize+reverb+tape+grunge

To turn off fx:

    fx=none

Note: FX don't work on midi files.

FX are based on FFMPEG audio filters. You can create your own FX using the
af command, but this isn't for the faint at heart. Note that af commands
replace any fx you already have.

    af=aecho=0.8:0.9:500|1000:0.3|0.25

If audio fails to play, your af command is not formulated properly.
Reset audio filters via:

    af=none
