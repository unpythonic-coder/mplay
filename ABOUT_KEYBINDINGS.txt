MPLAY KEYBINDINGS
===============================================================================
I tried to keep many of the classic cplay keybindings, but ultimately some
were changed/replaced to add new features.
And note that case matters. Except in a few cases when it doesn't.


PLAYBACK
===============================================================================
ENTER           play selected song

p               long press to play selected song

> or .          play next song

< or ,          play previous song

z or p          pause playback (stops midi)

x               stops playback


NAVIGATION
===============================================================================
ENTER          open selected directory

BACKSPACE      moves up one directory

UP or k        move selector up

DOWN or j      move selector down

PG UP or K     move up one page

PG DN or J     move down one page

HOME           move to start of list (Control 'h' also works)

END            move to end of list (Control 'e' also works)

LEFT           seeks backward (if audio format supports it)

RIGHT          seeks forward (can't seek midi or mod/tracker)

g              input a directory and go to it
               -can be a full path, but will attempt to find dir names as well
               -searches shorter than 3 characters act like 'find'
               -press up arrow to cancel input (works with most input fields)

F              find file or directory in current directory (ignores case)

G              find again

M              Jump to Music directory (can be set in mplay.config)

H              Jump to Home directory

P              Jump to Playlist directory (~/.config/mplay/playlists)


PLAYLIST MANAGEMENT
===============================================================================
TAB            toggles between filelist and playlist

a              from filelist, appends selected file(s) or directory
               -if files are marked, acts on them rather than current selection

SPACE or m     marks/selects files. Will also unmark marked files.
               -and automatically moves selector down

i              Inverts marked/selection. Unlike cplay, it will not mark
               directories

D or DELETE    In playlist mode, deletes marked from playlist
               -if nothing marked, deletes file at current position
               -confirmation is optional and can be set in mplay.config

U              Unmark all files

{ and }        Moves CURRENTLY selected item up or down (not marked)

W              Write playlist (it will ask for confirmation and filename)

S              Shuffle playlist

M              Toggles play mode between play-all, oneshot, and random.
               -I recommend using oneshot when auditioning short audio samples

L              Toggles playlist looping on and off.

E              Erase playlist


SORTING and FILTERING
===============================================================================
n              Sort by filename (ignores case)
               -pressing again reverses list

t              Sort by song title
               -sorts by filename if metadata isn't available

s              Sort by size
               -directories sorted by readable file count, not overall size

d              Sort by modification date

u              Sort by dUration
               -will not be accurate until metadata has fully loaded

r              Reverses sort

R              Playlist mode only: sorts by aRtist

P              Playlist mode only: sorts by Playlist position
               -newly created playlists do not have position data
               -playlist must be saved or opened first

f              Input text to filter files or playlist (ignores case)
               -filter WILL search metadata if available
               -can limit search to specific field
                   possible choices: name, title, album, artist, genre, year
                   example: year=1995
               -use '=' for includes, '!' for does not include
                   example: title!chrono
               -BACKSPACE exits filter


APPEARANCE
===============================================================================
To further customize mplay's appearance, edit ~/.config/mplay/mplay.config
And check out the command line args with: mplay --help
===============================================================================
l              change list mode (moves forward)
               -toggles between names, paths, file info
               -and metadata, if you have it switched on
               -custom views can be created via mplay.config

;              change list mode (moves backward)

               -color overrides do NOT affect custom themes

T              Reset themes (turn off color overrides)

! (shift 1)    Set screensaver to 'eink'
               -text dances on screen without obscuring your playlist

@ (shift 2)    Set screensaver to 'modem'
               -slowly loads metadata (including comments) while song plays
               -Works well with mod/tracker files (if mplay is using ffprobe)

# (shift 3)    Set screensaver to 'matrix'
               -still a classic

$ (shift 4)    Set screensaver to 'khaos'
               -pseudo visualizer using the matrix particle engine
               -looks better on large terminals

% (shift 5)    Set screensaver to 'plankton'
               -cyber plankton swim across the screen

^ (shift 6)    Set screensaver to 'tetragon'
               -tetragons everywhere
               -the final screensaver created for mplay, and maybe the best

& (shift 7)    Set screensaver to 'rave'
               -lasers and flashing lights

* (shift 8)    Set screensaver to 'pixels'
               -large pixels move across top and bottom of screen

f              Hides the screensaver footer on sync targets


TAGGING (requires music-tag)
===============================================================================
control T      Add title tag to currently selected file (not marked)
               -You can't apply title to multiple files at once

control R      Add artist tag to marked files or currently selected
               -will ask for confirmation if multiple files marked

control A      Add album tag to marked files or currently selected

control G      Add genre tag to marked files or currently selected

control Y      Add year tag to marked files or currently selected
               -due to an apparent bug, year may not save for mp3 files

I (shift i)    View album art for currently selected file (not marked)
               -Album art can't be added from mplay, but can be viewed
               -this launches your default image viewer

h             toggle help

R             Reload directory (filelist only)

q             Confirm and quit

Q             Quit now


BONUS FEATURES
===============================================================================
O (shift o)    Open selected audio file in either (a)udacity or (m)ilkytracker
               -Obviously, this would require audacity and milkytracker
               -if file is midi, and lmms installed, can also open in (l)mms

/              Toggle record for net radio streams (requires streamripper)
               -records the currently playing radio channel/stream
               -will record up to 1 GB and then stop
               -otherwise, it won't stop until you cancel recording
               or quit mplay
               -if mplay crashes during recording,
               run 'mplay --kill' to force it to stop
               -and if that doesn't kill streamripper, try:
                    pkill streamripper
               -note that not all streams support recording

?              Toggle the stat bar if screensaver is playing

               -stat bar requires "psutil"

|              Loads midi config that you input(requires timidity)
               -to return to default midi config, enter 'default' or 'none'
               -this requires a bit of setup to work properly
               -add soundfonts to ~/.config/mplay/timidity/soundfonts
               -then create timidity config files that point to the soundfonts
               (one config file per soundfont)
               -example of timidity config:
                    dir ~/.config/mplay/timidity/soundfonts
                    soundfont FluidR3_GM.sf2

               -allows you to set different soundfonts for each midi file
               -change (l)ist mode to "names" to see assigned midi config
               -and remember to write the playlist if you want to save changes

C (shift c)    Command Entry
               -This allows you to access features that don't have a keybinding

               -some of these features are experimental
               -commands are always in the form of "command=argument"
