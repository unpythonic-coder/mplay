CUSTOM THEMES
========================================================================
To further customize mplay, modify the custom theme settings located in:
~/.config/mplay/mplay.config

Custom themes can use the following format:

    COLOR
    COLOR+STYLE1
    COLOR+STYLE1+STYLE2
    COLOR+STYLE1+STYLE2+STYLE3

custom_theme_style_main is required, the rest are optional
-missing elements will draw from custom_theme_syle_main

To see a list of possible colors, run:
    mplay --color=?

Note that YELLOW-ON-BLACK and BLACK-ON-YELLOW+REVERSE may render
entirely different shades, depending on the terminal you are using.
-especially when paired with DIM or BOLD

Possible styles are:
    NORMAL, DIM, BOLD, STANDOUT, REVERSE, UNDERLINE, BLINK, ITALIC, LOW

-Some of these styles may not be supported by your terminal
